            <h2><span style="color:coral">World's Ultra Simple Asset Numbers Game</span></h2>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="content-subhead">Cashu ecash is here.</h2>
            <p style="text-align:left">Cashu <a href="http://nostrwiki.crrdlx.infinityfreeapp.com/doku.php?id=wiki:ecash-and-cashu" target="_blank">ecash</a> has come to <a href="https://wusang.vercel.app" target="_blank">Wusang: Isle of Blaq</a>. The cashu ecash protocol is another way to send bitcoin satoshis (sats).</p>
                
            <p>First, there was Hivebits (HBIT) - a mix of Hive's blockchain with bitcoin's ethos - was built into Wusang. Every time you "mine" Hivebits, you're playing Wusang.</p>

            <p>Along with the bonus treasure tokens, add bitcoin sats as ecash into the game. And, add a pirate's hidden treasure chest to the story. Somewhere on the Isle of Blaq there is a hidden cache of bitcoin satoshis. In addition to possibly finding a bonus token while playing Wusang, <u>you might find real bitcoin sats.</u></p>

    <h2 class="content-subhead">Q and A</h2>

<p><b>How many sats?</b> - It's a mystery. Think of it this way: we may know that a famous pirate hid a treasure chest out there somewhere, but we don't know how much is inside until someone finds the chest and opens it.</p>

<p><b>What are the odds?</b> - The odds are 10,000 to 1.</p>

<p><b>Those are long odds. What's up with that?</b></p> - Yes, those are long odds, and that's kind of the whole point. The idea is for this to be truly be rare. Hidden pirate treasure chests are not common. It may take a while, but math is math...someone *will* find the treasure chest of sats.

<p><b>Will I get rich if I find it?</b></p> - No, you'll get a few sats, but you will not get rich. You will, however, become a Wusang: Isle of Blaq legend. Finding the 1-in-10,000 hidden treasure cache would be pretty a pretty neat thing.

<p><b>Where do these sats come from?</b></p> - A few sats were frontloaded the treasure chest with some satoshis. From there, more might be added. 

<p><b>How does ecash work?</b></p> - There will be instructions if you find the treasure cache. However, you can research <a href="https://cashu.space" target="_blank">ecash and the cashu</a> protocol] if you wish. Essentially, when the cache is found, a private key will be revealed to the finder in a reply. That private key (cashu token) can be used to grab the ecash sats. 

<p><b>Is that it?</b></p> - Yes, but there's one important thing if you find the ecash treasure...you'll need to claim the sats before someone else does! Once found, the ecash token (the code to claim the sats) will be broadcast onto the Hive blockchain as a reply to the finder. However, this means that anyone who stumbles upon it can see that code and thus can claim the sats.

Think of it this way: you found a pirate's treasure chest, but you need to return to the ship to get a rowboat to load the treasure in to haul it away. While you're delayed, someone else might happen along, see your treasure chest and the key to open it, and scoop it up.

<p><b>Is this for real?</b></p> - Yes, this is real, and these are real satoshis. Cashu ecash is simply a different way to send sats. This is real bitcoin.

<h2 class="content-subhead">How can I search for the ecash cache?</h2>

<p>To look for the sats, simply play Wusang. And to do that, it's ultra simple...just play Wusang (mine HBIT). See <a href="play.html">Play</a> for details.</p>

<p>Happy sat hunting!</p>
