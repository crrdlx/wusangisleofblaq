            <h3 class="name">Wusang?</h3>
            <p>
                Wusang is an acronym for: <b>W</b>orld's <b>U</b>ltra <b>S</b>imple <b>A</b>ssett <b>N</b>umbers <b>G</b>ame
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>World's - anyone in the world can play it</li>
                <li>Ultra Simple - it's not simple, it's ultra simple</li>
                <li>Assett - you get crypto assets</li>
                <li>Numbers - there is a random element involved</li>
                <li>Game - you get HBIT each time, but if you're lucky, you may get more</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="idea">The idea for Wusang</h2>
            <p>
                The LUV token was created to share love with <i>others</i> on the Hive chain, then Hivebits (HBIT) spun off as a way for Hive users to earn for <i>themselves</i> due to their own effort. Hivebits has been about <i>your</i> effort earning <i>you</i> a reward. And, Hivebits will stay that way...your effort in Wusang: Isle of Blaq will get you one HBIT each day as your "pay" for your work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, from the start of HBIT, there was a desire to eventually include some type of randomness. There was a desire to gamefy things. Like rolling dice at the casino table, randomness adds an element of fun. So, now HBIT will integrate into Wusang: Isle of Blaq. This will mix the consistent and stable element of your-effort-means-your-reward every time with HBIT, along with a random chance of possibly getting another, <i>extra</i> treasure token in Wusang. You might <i>not</i> get another token, then again...there's a chance!
            </p>

            <h2 class="creator_vault">Creator tip</h2>
            <p>
                To help recoup costs to make this project, a 1% "tip" will be given to the creator of Wusang: Isle of Blaq for each "treasure token" found. That 1% tip will go to the @wusang.vault account.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>This 1% rule would <i>not</i> apply to HBIT. For instance, if Alice mines one HBIT, then 1.0 HBIT will go to her, and that's it. There's no change with Hivebits here.</li>
                <li>The 1% rule to the creator would only apply to extra "treasure tokens," like BLAQ.
                <li>Also, the 1% would be in <i>addition</i> to the treasure token, not 1% taken away from it. For instance, say Alice mined HBIT, got her 1.0 HBIT, but also randomly finds one "BLAQ" pearl token, then Wusang will send her 1.0 BLAQ and 0.01 BLAQ will go to the @wusang.vault account.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="terms-of-use">Terms</h2>
            <p>
                Consider Wusang: Isle of Blaq purely for fun. Although it's free to play, and although you can certainly sell or trade any of your tokens, <i>don't consider this any type of investment</i>. Things may change in the future, such as the numbers of tokens (new treasure tokens <i>might</i> emerge!), or the odds of finding the tokens, or anything else for that matter.
            </p>
