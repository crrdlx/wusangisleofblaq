            <h2 class="content-subhead">The idea for Wusang</h2>
            <p>
                The LUV token was created to share love with <i>others</i> on the Hive chain. It's about giving to others and expecting nothing in return. Then, Hivebits (HBIT) spun off as a way for Hive users to earn for <i>themselves</i> due to their <i>own</i> effort. Hivebits has been about <i>your</i> effort earning <i>you</i> a reward.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet, from the <a href="https://peakd.com/hive/@hivebits/introducing-hivebits" target="_blank">start of HBIT</a>, there was a desire to eventually include some type of randomness. There was a desire to gamefy things. Like rolling dice at the casino table, randomness adds an element of fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, now HBIT will integrate into <span style="color:darkturquoise">Wusang: Isle of Blaq</span>. This will mix the consistent and stable element of your-effort-means-your-reward-every-time with HBIT, along with a random chance of possibly getting another, <i>extra</i>, treasure token in Wusang. You might <i>not</i> get another token, but then again...there's a chance!
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Creator tip</h2>
            <p>
                Transparency is important to me (@crrdlx). I try to be open about things and try to answer any questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                This game is free for anyone to play, however, there are some costs involved to me. There is a monthly server fee, not large, but it's there. Each token in the game costed 100 BEE to create. To perhaps help recoup some costs, to maybe help sustain things, and <u>maybe</u> even to build toward the <i>next</i> 100 BEE "treasure token", a 1% "tip" is built into the game. It will go to the @wusang.vault account which is controlled by @crrdlx.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>This 1% tip would <i>not</i> apply to HBIT. For instance, if Alice uses <i>any</i> Wusang <i>or</i> HBIT command, then 1.0 HBIT will go to her. This is the way HBIT has always run. There's no change with Hivebits here.</li>
                <li>A hard-and-fast rule of Hivebits has been "Proof-of-Comment", meaning, your effort, your reward...every time. This is to ensure that every HBIT is backed by the guarantee that someone's work on the Hive chain consciously "mined" that one HBIT. This rule remains.</li>
                <li>The 1% rule to the creator would <i>only</i> apply to extra treasure tokens, like BLAQ.
                <li>Also, the 1% would be in <i>addition</i> to the treasure token, not 1% taken <i>away</i> from it. For instance, say Alice mined HBIT, got her 1.0 HBIT, but also randomly finds one "BLAQ" pearl token, then Wusang will send her 1.0 BLAQ and 0.01 BLAQ will go to the @wusang.vault account.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Terms</h2>
            <p>
                By playing <span style="color:darkturquoise">Wusang: Isle of Blaq</span> you're agreeing to these terms. Consider this purely for entertainment purposes. Although it's <u>free to play</u>, and though you can certainly sell or trade any of the tokens you earn or find, <i>don't consider this any type of investment</i>. Things may change in the future, such as the numbers of tokens in the game (new treasure tokens <i>might</i> emerge!), or quantities of tokens awarded, or the odds of finding the tokens, or <i>anything</i> else for that matter. This is for fun.
