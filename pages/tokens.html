            <p>
                The waters and soil of the Isle of Blaq are steeped in treasure. The natural bounty of the land and water produce the famed "Pearls of Wusang." Wars and raids, looting and pirating have littered the waters with precious metals and gemstones. Many treasures are known to have gone down with ships. Many are known to be buried in secret locales. And, there <i>may</i> be even more treasures, even more rare and exotic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, three treasure tokens have been documented in Wusang: Isle of Blaq...
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">BLAQ pearl</h2>
            <p>
                The legendary "Pearls of Wusang" are what initially brought treasure seekers to the Isle of Blaq. The waters of the Wusang region...clean and temperate and crystalline pure...grew the most flawless of pearls.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">BLAQGOLD</h2>
            <p>
                Traders and thieves were drawn to the Isle of Blaq by the lure of the Blaq pearl. They brought with them gold. Soon, the Isle of Blaq had its own coin minted, the BLAQGOLD. It quickly grew as the base currency of the island, thriving in the shops and storehouses and taverns conducting honest business. But also thriving among the shady, swindling, thieving, and back-stabbing world of pirates and prostitutes and corrupt politicians. Much BLAQGOLD wound up on the bottom on the sea around the Isle. Much BLAQGOLD is hidden in the soil and caverns of the Isle. All is waiting to be found.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">BLAQEMRLD</h2>
            <p>
                As the economy blossomed in and around the Isle of Blaq, riches untold emerged. One ship, "La Marfa del Mar" sailed to the Isle with honest intent to trade. In the holds of the Marfa was a store of wheat and barley...grains that could not be grown in the Wusang region...but prized for bread and whiskey and ale. When a weak quartermaster saw the beauty of the Pearls of Wusang, he leaked out a secret. In addition to grain, the Marfa housed a store of pristine Peruvian emeralds. He would gladly skim a few emeralds from the stores in exchange for a sack of pearls from opportunist pirates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, when the deal was to be made, the quartermaster was double-crossed by the pirates. He lost his life to a cross bow's bolt and the pirates commandeered the ship. When the Marfa's crew became aware of the heist, they set the ship afire. The Marfa burnt to the waterline and then sank offshore of the Isle of Blaq. Legend is that not a soul survived, and that the pirate captain went down clinging to the Emeralds of Blaq. The whereabouts of the emeralds remains a mystery to this day.
